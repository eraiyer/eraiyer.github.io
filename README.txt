1. Currently, this website contains 3 pages--a home page, a bio page, and
a resume. Each of these pages is linked to its own stlying (css) file. So
far, the buttons between pages are correctly implemented, the image is properly
formatted to fit a computer screen, and the content on each page is cohesive 
and properly formatted. I have yet to update the styling issues on different 
devices, particularly for screens smaller than a computer (like an iphone). 
In the future, I would like to implement a feature that allows for scrolling
down to a new page when clicking on a button rather than moving to an entirely
new page. 

2. My friend Radhika and I both had confusion on how to upload the website onto
the Tufts servers. She and I asked one of the TAs, Kingsley, for help on this.
Thanks again, Kingsley!

3. I spent approximately 4-5 hours working on this project.
