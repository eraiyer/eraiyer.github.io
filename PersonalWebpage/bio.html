		<p class = "titles">Early Life and Education</p>
		<p> I was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, and
			came to Medford, MA to attend college at Tufts University.</p>

		<p class = "titles">Biography</p>
		<p> I am currently a sophomore at Tufts University, where I am 
		double majoring in computer science and economics. My interest in 
		computer science deepened after participating in the Girls Who Code
		summer immersion program when I was in high school. Here, I realized
		the power of code and importance of empowering more girls to pursue a 
		career in tech. Since then, I have gone on to create my own iOS app, 
		called WorldOfMusic, TA for Girls Who Code, and become an active member
		of the computer science community at Tufts. Currenlty, I am a student 
		programmer for Tufts' JumboCode, a consultant for 180 Degree Consulting,
		and a Teaching Assistant for Computer Science 15: Data Structures. </p>

		<p class = "titles">Hobbies</p>
		<p> I am a member of the Tufts Club Tennis Team, a classically trained
		soprano, and a passionate artist. </p>
